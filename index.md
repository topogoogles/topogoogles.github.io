# Agust√≠n Esteban Araujo

Hi there! I'm a motivated and technically adept Junior Python Developer with comprehensive
certification achievements and hands-on experience in Python programming, generative AI, and IT
automation. I'm proficient in leveraging AI tools, web development frameworks, and automation
techniques to enhance productivity and solve complex problems. My skills include Python web
development (Django), data visualization (Matplotlib), and natural language processing (NLTK). I
also have a strong foundation in IT support, configuration management, and version control
(Git/GitHub), and I'm committed to continuous learning in the rapidly advancing fields of AI and
software development. I'm excited to apply my diverse skill set to contribute to innovative project
development and problem-solving in a dynamic team environment.
